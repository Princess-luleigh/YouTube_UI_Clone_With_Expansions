# The good UI & UX design principles

## User Interface structure standards speak to significant level ideas that are utilized to direct programming plan. The following are the UI & UX principles that the YouTube app has followed:
- **Spot clients in charge of the interface**
  - YouTube gives users full control of the part they are on, which is comfortable, you can watch any video you choose to watch or search. It also allows quick backtracking, where     the user can quickly undo a step and go back to where they were, this makes it easier to use it without fear that one might ruin anything. If you click on a video by mistake       while watching another video, you can simply click on the 'back' arrow to return to where you were.
- **Make it agreeable to associate with an item** 
  - It is enjoyable, does not force users to repeat data that they have already entered. Uses simple language that is understandable, instead of system-generated language or jargon. The size of its important buttons like cancel or enter is easier to work with, as you cannot click on the other button next to the target by mistake (applies Fitts's law). In case the user enters a wrong message, the error messages handling that are good and they point the user towards not making the same mistake again, like when logging in and      entering a wrong email adress it will tell you to enter a valid email, that way you will double check the text you have entered to make sure you enter the correct one next time.
- **Diminish psychological burden** 
  - Users do not really have to think or work too hard to use YouTube. To select an item you can either click once or twice for it to respond, not more than that. The icons are       clear and easy to understand them and their functions, you do not need to memorise them and how they work. A home icon is just home, trending is a fire emoji (for hot             content!) and all the other icons.  
- **Make user interfaces steady**
  - The visuals are consistent. The same color is carried out throughtout the whole app. Surprises are rare, the same work the subscription tab performs stays like that, basically     there is functional consistency. It is what users expect, you go there to watch videos that is what you will get and more!
- **Chain of command**
  - A visual hierarchy is a way that designers help users navigate more easily within a section or page. The use of different fonts and colors for different sections make it           enjoyable and less tiring to move around a page. Titles on each video make it easier to distinguish between videos and not get lost there.
